# Problem 1

**a)**

**1.**
\newline
* `Estimate` - in particular interpretation of `Intercept`
\newline 
Estimated regression coefficients given by 
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\mathbf{Y}$$.
\newline where $X$ is the design matrix of the regression, $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector containing the observed response values and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is a vector containing the estimated regression coefficients. The interpretation of the regression coefficients is that if we increase covariate $x_j$ with one unit, and keeping all other covariates constant, the response variable changes with a factor of $\hat{\beta_j}$.

* `Std.Error`
\newline 
Estimated standard deviation of the estimated regression coefficients, i.e the average amount that the estimated regression coefficients vary from the actual value. The Std.Error is given by 
$$\widehat{\text{SD}}(\hat{\beta_j}) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2(X^TX)^{-1}_{jj}}$$, where $X$ is the design matrix of the regression, and $\hat{\sigma}$ is the residual standard error.

* `t value`
\newline
Value of the t-statistic for testing whether the corresponding regression coefficient is different from 0. The t-value is given by 
$$t = $$

*`P(>|t|)`
